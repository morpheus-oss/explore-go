/**
Race Condition:
A race condition occurs when two or more goroutines perform operations on a shared
variable that depend on the variableâ€™s current state, and the goroutines interleave
their operations in an unpredictable way.

Program Explanation:
Shared Resource:
 - In this program 'sharedVar' is accessed by two goroutines: one increments the value
 	and the other decrements the value.
 - As both the goroutines are working on the same variable without syncronization, their
	operations may overlap, leading to unpredictable behavior.

Goroutines:
incrementer - increments the shared variable 1000 times.
decrementer - decrements the shared variable 1000 times.

No Race Condition:
In case if the goroutines were synchronized, the final value of 'sharedVar' would always
be '0', because 1000 increments and 1000 decrements would cancel each other out.

What happens (Race Condition):
 - Due to the lack of synchronization, both goroutines may read, modify, and write to
 	sharedVar at the same time.
 - For example, while incrementer is reading the current value of sharedVar, decrementer
	may also read the same value, causing both to update the variable based on the same
	initial value.
 - This leads to inconsistent modifications, and the final value of sharedVar will often
 	not be 0.
